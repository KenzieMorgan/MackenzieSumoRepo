Version1
When working on Version1 of the game it was just programming in the character controls and 
tweaking them to feel more natural whilst playing the game

Version2
Working on Version2 the ai was created to chase after the player and adding the ability to 
bounce off of the player pushing both the player and enemy back

Version3
A PowerUp was added which has a timer attached to it making it last a limited time
off the platform

Version4
Added enemy spawns that increase in scale, during this the PowerUp was adjusted to 7 seconds
in order to make it last long enough to knock enemies off easily earlier on but becomes harder
to do as the game progresses

Version5
Added SFX and BGM in order to increase immersion and added a jump to add more ways to get
arround enemies

Version6
Ballanced audio and increased camera turn speed in order to make the game control easier
as well as adding a menu with the option to quit the game

Version7
Jump was tweaked in order to make jumping over enemies more tight making it possible
to do so however making it risky to do as you may be quickly knocked off the platform
